## About Filr

<strong><a href="https://filrdemo.emtechint.com" target="_blank">Filr</a> is your online small file folder. Simply store files and access them when you want.
Filr's goal is to keep it simple when it comes to file storage just like a physical folder works: you place your document there and access it when you want and do whatever you want with it, but you don't edit it from the folder.
* No online file editing or sharing, just storing only.
