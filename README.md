## About Filr

Filr is your online small file folder. Simply store files and access them when you want.
Filr's goal is to keep it simple when it comes to file storage just like a physical folder works: you place your document there and access it when you want and do whatever you want with it.
* No inline file editing or sharing, just storing only.
